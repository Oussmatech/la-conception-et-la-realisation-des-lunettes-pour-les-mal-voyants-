## 📌 Project Overview

![Project Overview](https://github.com/Ibenammou/Smart-Irrigation-and-Pest-Detection-System/blob/master/image.webp)

This project aims to develop an intelligent irrigation system that automates watering based on soil moisture levels while detecting pests using a camera and AI. The system is controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller and provides real-time monitoring via a web dashboard.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Irrigation:** Adjusts watering based on soil moisture sensors.
- **Pest Detection:** Uses a camera and AI to identify harmful pests.
- **ESP32 Connectivity:** Sends data to a cloud/server for remote access.
- **User Dashboard:** Web-based interface for monitoring and control.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for pest detection and irrigation status.
- **Simulation Features:** Allows users to simulate temperature increase and detect anomalies in real-time.
- **Interactive Learning:** Enables children to understand smart irrigation through hands-on simulations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** ESP32, Soil Moisture Sensor, Temperature Sensor, Camera Module, Water Pump
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python (for AI model), Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Cloud Services:** Firebase / AWS / ThingsBoard (optional for data storage)
